# Trip
My Favorite Family Vacation Spot As soon as I got of the plane and breathed in that City air I new my life would change for the better. I was waiting for this day for the past several months. It was the first time I would go with my father and brothers on their “Boys Only Vacation”. I was thrilled at the fact that they would finally let me tag along with them.
